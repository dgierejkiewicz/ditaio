Ditaio - Task scheduler using coroutines
========================================

This project implements a cooperative task scheduler using coroutines. The implementation is described in [this blog post][blog_post].

To try it out you will need a recent PHP 5.5 build (newer than alpha 2). Otherwise some parts like exception handling will not work.

Maybe I will develop this a bit further so it becomes actually usable.
